talk.js
=======

*talk.js* is a direct port of [PocketSphinx 0.7](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx/0.7/) lightweight speech recognition engine to JavaScript using [Emscripten](http://www.emscripten.org).

A *demo* is available at http://cirlanaru.com/srec-web/wami.html. It uses the [WAMI-recorder](http://code.google.com/p/wami-recorder/) to capture the microphone audio for decoding and also provides an interface to upload your own WAVE/RAW audio files.
